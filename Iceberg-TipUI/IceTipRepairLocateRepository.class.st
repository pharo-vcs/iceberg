I'm a repair action to locate the directory were a repository resides.

I'm active when repository can not be located in disk.

Notice that doing this can lead you to another situation that needs repair (like a detached status)

This situation happens when iceberg cannot find the repository in disk.

This action will very probably let you in a detached status, because this only changes the location of the repository, but it does not affect the current commit (HEAD) or the current branch.
You will need to re-synchronize your repository with another repair action.

This happens if the repository has been removed from the disk or the image was pointing to a repository in another machine (For example, when sharing images with other machines / people).'
