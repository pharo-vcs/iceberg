"
I'm a switch and merge merging type. 
I will switch first to the new branch, and then I will perform a merge with current reference commit.

	1. Switch to merging branch.
	2. Merging branch <- reference commit
	
This strategy is used to re-attach image when it is detached from current development branch.
