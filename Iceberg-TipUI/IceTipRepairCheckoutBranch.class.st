This action will checkout the branch in the repository and synchronize your image with your repository.

This situation happens because the code loaded in your image does not correspond with the status of your repository.

This action opens a preview window before doing any change.

This operation will modify the state of your working copy on disk. All non-commited changes in your disk working copy that are not in the image will be lost (this can happen if you edited the repository from outside). If you want to keep them, perform a commit from outside before.'
